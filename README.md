# SudokuSolver
Animated sudoku solver written in an ipython notebook for academic purposes.

It inputs new numbers based on the main three rules (unique numbers on each row, column, and square) and uses the backpropagation method whenever new numbers cannot be inputted based on those rules. It includes visualization, both in ascii mode, and using animations in matploblit to illustrate the solving process.
